# RecipeWebsiteBackend

This is the Node.js, Express.js, Mysql, Prisma backend server for the API.

I am using Node.js, Express.js for the base setup of my API server and then with the help of Mysql and Prisma. I am able to then create the api calls that would be required to then query the database and finalize the front-end.

This is specifically the backend for the RecipeWebsite at the following link which is using React.js and react router to create the SPA (Single Page Application) that is being served out to the browsers.

# Frontend

The frontend is develop using Javascript, HTML, CSS, React.js and the React Router for navigation.
